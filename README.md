# CryptoTracker

CryptoTracker is a cryptocurrency tracking application that fetches live data from the [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api) and displays key information such as the coinâ€™s price, volume, and market cap. Users can add coins to a personalized **watchlist**, which is stored in the browserâ€™s `localStorage`. The watchlist feature allows users to toggle their favorite coins and keeps them saved until manually removed.

## Components

### **Grid Component**

This component displays individual coin data in a grid format, which is clickable and navigates to the detailed page of the coin. It also includes a star icon for adding/removing coins to/from the watchlist.

#### Props
- `coin`: Object containing the coin's details such as price, volume, and market cap.

#### Example

```jsx
<Grid coin={coin} />
```

### **List Component**

The `List` component renders a table of all the cryptocurrencies fetched from the API, displaying price, percentage change, and the star icon for adding/removing from the watchlist.

#### Props
- `coins`: Array of coin objects that need to be displayed.

#### Example

```jsx
<List coins={coins} />
```

### **Watchlist Page**

This component displays all the coins that have been added to the watchlist. It fetches the saved list from `localStorage` on page load.

---

## API Integration

The app integrates with the CoinGecko API to fetch real-time data on cryptocurrencies. API requests are made using Axios for efficient HTTP requests.

### Example API Request

```js
const fetchCoinsData = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get(
      `https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/markets`,
      { params: { vs_currency: 'usd', ids: coinIds.join(',') } }
    );
    setWatchlistCoins(response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching coins", error);
  }
};
```

### API Reference

- **Base URL**: `https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/`
- **Endpoints Used**:
  - `/coins/markets` for fetching market data for a list of coins.

## Watchlist Functionality

### Adding a Coin to Watchlist

The watchlist functionality is implemented using `localStorage`. When a user clicks the star icon, the `coin.id` is saved to a `Set` in `localStorage`. The coin remains on the watchlist until manually removed.

### LocalStorage Integration

```js
const [watchlist, setWatchlist] = useState(new Set());

useEffect(() => {
  const savedWatchlist = localStorage.getItem('watchlist');
  if (savedWatchlist) {
    setWatchlist(new Set(JSON.parse(savedWatchlist)));
  }
}, []);

useEffect(() => {
  localStorage.setItem('watchlist', JSON.stringify([...watchlist]));
}, [watchlist]);
```

---

## Toast Notifications

To enhance the user experience, **react-toastify** is used for toast notifications when adding/removing coins from the watchlist.

### Toast Example

```js
toast.success('Added to watchlist');
toast.info('Removed from watchlist');
```

### Toast Configuration

```jsx
<ToastContainer
  position="bottom-right"
  autoClose={3000}
  hideProgressBar={false}
  closeOnClick
  pauseOnHover
/>
```
